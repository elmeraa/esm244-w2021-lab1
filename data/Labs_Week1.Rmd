```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

### Read in SF trees data
```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data","sf_trees","sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling & summary statistics using functions in the 'dplyr' package.

Find the top 5 highest observation of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.
```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  relocate(tree_count) %>% 
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5)
```
